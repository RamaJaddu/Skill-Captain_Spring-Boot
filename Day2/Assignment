Assignments:

Expand the "Hello World" REST API

Objective: - Build upon the existing "Hello World" REST API implemented in the tutorial. - Extend the API to include additional endpoints and functionality.

Tasks:
1. Create a new endpoint `/greet/{name}` that accepts a path parameter representing a person's name and returns a personalized greeting. For example, a request to `/greet/John` should return "Hello, John!".
2. Implement error handling for invalid or empty name values. Return an appropriate error message and status code when the name parameter is missing or blank.
3. Add a new endpoint `/greet/{name}/{language}` that accepts both name and language parameters. Return a greeting message based on the specified language. For example, `/greet/John/es` should return "Hola, John!" for Spanish.
4. Implement support for handling HTTP POST requests. Create an endpoint `/greet` that accepts a JSON payload with a name field and returns a greeting message. Test this endpoint using tools like cURL or Postman.
5. Add unit tests to verify the behavior of the new endpoints. Write test cases to cover different scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs.

Submission:
1. Submit the updated source code with the expanded API. 2. Include any new classes or modifications made to existing classes. 3. Include a brief document describing the changes made and any challenges faced during the assignment.

This assignment will allow you to practice extending the functionality of a Spring Boot REST API and reinforce the concepts covered in the tutorial. It encourages you to explore additional endpoints, handle different types of requests, and perform unit testing to ensure the desired behavior of the API.
